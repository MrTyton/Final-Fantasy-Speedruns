\begin{battle}[4000]{Extractor}
In this fight you need to apply Slow to extractor with Stunning Steel. You can check after each of Tidus' Attacks if Slow has been applied by looking at the turn order. If Slow has been applied Tidus and Wakka will get more than one turn each after some boss turns.
\newline \ \newline
On Extractor's 3rd turn it will rise. After extractor falls back down it will always use Aqua shooter on it's next turn and then it will randomly choose between Aqua Shooter and Rise on subequent turns. You need to deal 500 damage to Extractor once it has risen to force it back down and this is only possible with 4 Attacks, 2 from each of Wakka and Tidus. You need to make sure you always have 4 turns following a turn in which Extractor can rise, so you will need to pay attention to the turn order and use Switch Weapon, where necessary, to fix the turn order to make the fight safe.
